Hi, I'm Christopher R McGuire. I have built and lead teams with a UX/UI/Frontend design and development :hammer_and_wrench: focus at <a href="https://www.citadel.com">Citadel</a>, <a href="https://www.spiderrock.net">SpiderRock</a> and most recently Akuna Capital in Chicago, IL. 
I've always been passionate about evangelizing the importance of great user experience and design within the Financial Services Industry. In my previous roles, I've had the opportunity to work on and lead a variety of large-scale proprietary projects - most of which I can't show you because they involve classified information or :earth_americas:	world domination schemes (or both). But trust me, they're there ;)
What really excites me is being able to use my blend of design and engineering skillsets to solve problems and deliver performant frontend systems. When I'm not geeking out over code or designing interfaces, I can be found at home in Chicago, most likely watching tv or consuming information for hours on end, becoming lost in the :rabbit:	rabbit hole of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.
